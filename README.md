Data Science project (French engineering school Mines Nancy) on recommendation systems. Using python and classic py-libraries.

## pandas101.py

### I. Create tables with different methods
For instance use data.xls to do an import from an excel sheet.
NB: To make excel integration works with pandas, think to install the xlrd package (UNIX command: $ pip install xlrd)
